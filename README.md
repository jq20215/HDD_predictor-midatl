# HDD_predictor-midatl-

Developed in order to predict the number of Heating-Degree-Days in the mid-atlantic region of the United States. Before I learned you can get much more specific data from NOAA,
I utilized EIA datasets to develop my prediction model. Used Towards Data Science guide articles to help with some of the model building, specifically the arch.unitroot tests, outlier detection and removal methods, and utils_eval and plot methods. 

This model was used to help in volumetric forecasting for natural gas demand in the mid-atlantic region based on the number of Heating-Degree-Days (daily avg) in a given month.
